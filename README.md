# MCP Auth website & docs

MCP Auth gives you everything you need to add production-ready auth to your MCP server, without losing weeks to spec docs and edge cases.

## Highlights

**Skip the specs. Skip the boilerplate. Just auth.**

The MCP spec [requires OAuth 2.1 and other RFCs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) for auth. Instead of spending weeks on them, use MCP Auth to connect to an trusted provider with a few lines of code.

**Connect to any provider. It's provider-agnostic.**

MCP Auth works with any compliant OAuth 2.1 or OpenID Connect provider. Choose one from our verified list or use the tool to check if your provider is compliant.

**Let's ship fast, and be secure.**

Go for production? We've got you covered. MCP Auth follows the spec and best practices, so you can launch with confidence.
