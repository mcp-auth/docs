## Why MCP Auth?

Building an MCP (Model Control Protocol) server can be fun; but adding authentication and authorization can get a bit tricky.

The MCP specification [requires OAuth 2.1](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) for authorization. But before diving into the lengthy RFCs, have you ever wondered if there's a simpler way to get started? For instance, by integrating with an existing OAuth or OpenID Connect provider?

That's where MCP Auth comes in. It's a set of tools and libraries designed to connect your MCP server with your preferred authorization provider.

And yes, it can be as simple as a few lines of code:

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
mcp_auth = MCPAuth(
    server=fetch_server_config('<auth-server-url>', type=AuthServerType.OIDC)
)
app = Starlette(middleware=[
    Middleware(mcp_auth.bearer_auth_middleware("jwt", require_scopes=["read", "write"]))
    # `request.state.auth` will contain the auth info
])
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```ts
const mcpAuth = new MCPAuth({
  server: await fetchServerConfig('<auth-server-url>', { type: 'oidc' }),
});
const handleBearerAuth = mcpAuth.bearerAuth('jwt', { requireScopes: ['read', 'write'] });

app.use('/mcp', handleBearerAuth, (req, res) => {
  // `req.auth` contains the auth info
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
MCP Auth is designed to be provider-agnostic, meaning you can use it with any specification-compliant OAuth 2.1 or OpenID Connect provider.

## Is my provider supported?

MCP Auth has been tested with the following providers:

- [Logto](https://logto.io/): A modern, open-source identity solution that supports OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect.

See the [providers list](./providers-list.mdx) for more details. You can also [test your provider](./providers-list.mdx#test-your-provider) by entering the URL of the authorization server issuer.

## Who developed MCP Auth?

MCP Auth is developed by Logto, a team with extensive experience in building standards-compliant, open-source authentication and authorization solutions.
