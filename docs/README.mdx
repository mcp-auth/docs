# Introduction

## Why MCP Auth?

**Auth for MCP servers shouldn't be a headache.**

Building your own MCP (Model Control Protocol) server? That's fun.<br/>Wrestling with OAuth 2.1, OpenID Connect, and a pile of RFCs? Not so much.

The MCP spec [requires OAuth 2.1 and other RFCs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) for authorization. **MCP Auth** gives you everything you need to add production-ready auth to your MCP server, without losing weeks to spec docs and edge cases.

Here's what you get:

1. An updated list of OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect providers that pass the MCP compliance check.
2. Provider-agnostic libraries and utilities to plug auth into your MCP server.
3. Practical tutorials and copy-pasteable examples to get you up and running fast.

Yes, it really can be just a few lines of code:

<Tabs groupId="sdk">

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
mcp = FastMCP("MyMCPServer")
mcp_auth = MCPAuth(server=fetch_server_config('<auth-server-url>', type=AuthServerType.OIDC))
app = Starlette(
    # ... your MCP server setup
    middleware=[Middleware(
        mcp_auth.bearer_auth_middleware("jwt", required_scopes=["read", "write"])
    )]
)

# Use `mcp_auth.auth_info` to access the auth information for the current request
@mcp.tool()
def whoami() -> dict[str, Any]:
    return mcp_auth.auth_info.claims
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```ts
const server = new McpServer(/* ... */);
const mcpAuth = new MCPAuth({
  server: await fetchServerConfig('<auth-server-url>', { type: 'oidc' }),
});
const app = express();

app.use(mcpAuth.bearerAuth('jwt', { requiredScopes: ['read', 'write'] }));
server.tool('whoami', ({ authInfo }) => {
  // Use `authInfo` to access the auth information carried from `req.auth`
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### How about the MCP SDKs?

The official MCP SDKs (Python, Node.js, etc.) are a solid starting point. But when you're building something for production, especially around authentication and authorization, you'll quickly hit limitations.

**MCP Auth fills the gap between "it runs" and "it's secure, scalable, and maintainable."**

It's built to work with the SDKs and bring real-world-ready features like:

- First-class JWT support
- Provider-agnostic tooling
- Step-by-step tutorials for multiple identity providers

### Backed by the team behind Logto

MCP Auth is developed by the team behind [Logto](https://logto.io), a modern, open-source identity platform trusted by thousands of developers. With over 10,000 GitHub stars and 1 million+ managed identities, we've baked real-world experience directly into this project.

We stay on top of changes to the MCP spec and SDK ecosystem, so you don't have to.

## Is my provider supported?

If your provider supports OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect, there's a good chance it'll just work.

We've tested MCP Auth with:

- [Logto](https://logto.io): A modern, open-source identity solution that supports OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect.
