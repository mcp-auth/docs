# Tutorial: Build a todo manager

In this tutorial, we will build a todo manager MCP server with user authentication and authorization.

After completing this tutorial, you will have:

- âœ… A basic understanding of how to set up role-based access control (RBAC) in your MCP server.
- âœ… A MCP server that can manage personal todo lists.

:::note
Before you start, we strongly recommend you to go through the [Who am I tutorial](./whoami) first if you are not familiar with MCP server and OAuth 2.
